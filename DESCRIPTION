Description: We introduce improved methods for statistically assessing birth seasonality and intra-annual variation in &delta;<sup>18</sup>O from faunal tooth enamel. The first method we propose is a new idea that uses a nonparametric clustering procedure to group individuals with similar time series data and estimate birth seasonality based on the clusters. One can use the function `SCEM.R` to implement this method. The second method estimates input parameters for use with a previously-developed parametric approach (Tornero et al., 2013). The relevant code for this approach is `makeFits_OLS.R`, while `makeFits_initial.R` is the code to implement the same method but with given initial conditions for two parameters. The latter can be used to show the disadvantage of the existing approach. One can use the function `makeFits.R` to generate parametric birth seasonality estimates using either initialization.
