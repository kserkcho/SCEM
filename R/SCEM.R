#' @title Splitting-Coalescence-Estimation Method (SCEM) for archaeological time series.
#'
#' @description Performs the clustering algorithm SCEM on the bivariate time series data - where
#' one series is for the distance from the cementum-enamel junction, and the other series is for
#' the value of the oxygen-18 isotope at that distance - and returns the class-assignments and
#' birth seasobality estimates for all the individuals.
#'
#' @param paths A list of data frames, where each frame contains the data for one individual. There
#' should be two columns with names 'distance' and 'oxygen'.
#'
#' @param bandwidth Denotes the order of the bandwidth that should be used in the splitting-coalescence
#' (SC) clustering algorithm. A value k will mean that the bandwidth used in the algorithm is n^k.
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @return A list that contains a data frame and a list of vectors. The data frame has the individual
#' information (ID, species, number of observations in the time series), cluster assignment, estimated
#' period, delay and the birth seasonality estimate for every individual. The list of vectors gives the
#' groups formed by the clustering algorithm in the method.
