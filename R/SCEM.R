#' @title Splitting-Coalescence-Estimation Method (SCEM) for archaeological time series.
#'
#' @description This function performs the clustering algorithm SCEM on the bivariate time series data –
#' where one series is the distance from the cementum-enamel junction, and the other series is the value of
#' the oxygen-18 isotope at that distance. It returns the class assignments and birth seasonality estimates
#' for all the individuals.
#'
#' The SCEM assumes that the oxygen isotope values \eqn{(z(t))} can be expressed as a function of \eqn{x(t)},
#' the natural logarithm of the distance from the CEJ for each of the incremental samples, scaled down by
#' the period (\eqn{X}, the length of the tooth crown). In other words,
#'
#' \loadmathjax
#' \mjdeqn{z(t) = f(x(t)/X) + e(t)}{ASCII representation}
#'
#' where the form of \eqn{f} is unknown and \eqn{e(t)} is an error process.
#' Also, following our definition, it assumes that the value of \eqn{x(t)/X} that maximizes \eqn{z(t)} is the estimated birth seasonality.
#'
#' Birth seasonality is estimated using the combined data from all individuals in a single cluster,
#' but birth seasonality estimates for individuals in a cluster are based on individual estimates of the length of the tooth crown (\mjeqn{X_{k}}{ASCII representation}).
#'
#' For a detailed description of the algorithm, please see Chazin et al. 2019, Supplemental Materials 1.
#'
#' @param paths A list of data frames, where each frame contains the data for one individual. There
#' should be two columns with names 'distance' and 'oxygen'.
#'
#' @param bandwidth Denotes the order of the bandwidth that should be used in the splitting-coalescence
#' (SC) clustering algorithm. A value k will mean that the bandwidth used in the algorithm is n^k.

#' A list containing the following components:
#'
#' \item{results}{A data frame that has the individual information (ID, species, number of observations in the time series), cluster assignment, estimated period, delay and the birth seasonality estimate for every individual.}
#' \item{groups}{The groups formed by the clustering algorithm}
