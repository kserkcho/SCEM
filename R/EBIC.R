#' @title Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for a partition.
#'
#' @description This function calculates an extended version of BIC, which is computed using
#' a particular weighted average of the total residual sum of squares and the number of clusters.
#'
#' @param paths A list of data frames, where each frame contains the data for one individual. Every
#' data frame should have two columns with names 'distance' and 'oxygen'.
#'
#' @param partition A list of vectors. Each element in the list is a vector of integers, corresponding
#' to individuals considered in one group.
#'
#' @param bandwidth Denotes the order of the bandwidth that should be used in the estimation process.
#' bandwidth = k will mean that the bandwidth is n^k.
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @return Value of the extended BIC function for the partition.
