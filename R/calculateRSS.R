#' @title Residual sum of squares (RSS) for all time series in a group.
#'
#' @description The trend function for each individual time series is estimated non-parametrically
#' by the local linear estimate (as discussed in Fan and Gijbels (1996)). Then, the common trend
#' function for the group is estimated by taking the average over the group. Next, the shift functions
#' are estimated as the differences from the individual trend functions and finally, the residual sum
#' of squares are calculated  using the original values, the common trend functions and the shifts.
#'
#' @param paths A list of data frames, where each frame contains the data for one individual. Every
#' data frame should have two columns with names 'distance' and 'oxygen'.
#'
#' @param S A vector of integers showing which individuals are considered in the group.
#'
#' @param bandwidth Denotes the order of the bandwidth that should be used in the estimation process.
#' bandwidth = k will mean that the bandwidth is n^k.
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @return A vector of length equal to the group-size, so that each element is the RSS for the
#' corresponding individual in the group.
#'
#' @examples
#' armenia_split = split(armenia,f = armenia$ID)
#' band = -0.33
#' p = length(armenia_split)
#' calculateRSS(armenia_split,1:p,band)
