#' @title Cosine model fitting with given initialization for two parameters.
#'
#' @description Performs the updated nonlinear least squares (NLS) regression method for the cosine
#' model proposed by Balasse et al. The method calculates with the proposed initial values at first,
#' and then fits the NLS method as required.
#'
#' @param data A data frame that contains the data for one individual. There should be two columns
#' with names 'distance' and 'oxygen'.
#'
#' @param amplitude A number, corresponding to a given value for the amplitude parameter.
#'
#' @param intercept A number, corresponding to a given value for the intercept parameter.
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @return A fitted model object from the nls function in R.
